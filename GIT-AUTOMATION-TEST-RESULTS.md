🔍 RESTORING CONTEXT FROM LAST SESSION
════════════════════════════════════════

📅 LAST COMMIT:
   Commit: 5c496d9
   Date:   2025-10-21 12:32
   Message: Session update: Added/updated scripts...

📊 RECENT ACTIVITY (Last 10 commits):
   10/21 12:32 5c496d9 Session update: Added/updated scripts...
   10/20 23:00 a445f9c Remove non-functional conversation mirror
   10/20 15:37 7effa20 Initial commit: Autonomous Development

📁 FILES CHANGED IN LAST COMMIT:
      GETTING-STARTED.md
      NEW-SESSION-PROMPT.txt
      restore-context.sh
      send-to-slack.sh
      smart-git-commit.sh

```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- Shows latest commit correctly
- Displays recent commit history
- Lists files changed in last commit
- Shows current uncommitted changes
- Reports service status accurately
- Remote access heartbeat detected

---

## ✅ Test 5: Integration with Remote Access System

**Test:** Verify git commands integrated into start-remote-access.sh

**Commands Added:**
- `git-commit` - Smart commit without push
- `git-commit-and-push` - Commit and push to GitHub
- `git-status` - Show uncommitted changes
- `git-summary` - Last 5 commits + current state
- `restore-context` - Full context restoration

**Integration Points (start-remote-access.sh:206-247):**
```bash
elif [[ "$command" == "git-commit" ]] || [[ "$command" == "git-commit-and-push" ]]; then
    echo "🔧 Git commit command detected"
    local push_arg="no"
    if [[ "$command" == "git-commit-and-push" ]]; then
        push_arg="push"
    fi
    response=$("${SCRIPT_DIR}/smart-git-commit.sh" "$push_arg" 2>&1)
    exit_code=$?
elif [[ "$command" == "restore-context" ]]; then
    response=$("${SCRIPT_DIR}/restore-context.sh" 2>&1)
    exit_code=$?
# ... etc
```

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- All 5 git commands integrated
- Proper command detection logic
- Correct script execution
- Error handling in place

---

## ✅ Test 6: Documentation Updates

**Test:** Verify comprehensive documentation added

**Updated:** `GETTING-STARTED.md`

**Sections Added:**
- Git Operations (automatic backups)
- Smart Git Automation System overview
- Quick Commit workflows
- Commit and Push workflows
- Git Command Reference table
- Recommended Daily Workflow
- Git Recovery Scenarios
- Smart Commit Message Examples
- Security notes

**Lines Added:** 295 lines of documentation

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- Comprehensive user guide created
- Clear examples provided
- Workflow recommendations included
- Security considerations documented

---

## ✅ Test 7: Session Startup Template

**Test:** Verify NEW-SESSION-PROMPT.txt created

**File:** `NEW-SESSION-PROMPT.txt`

**Contents:**
- Main startup prompt template
- Alternative quick status prompt
- Task-specific prompt variations
- File reference guide
- Pro tips for new sessions

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- Complete template created
- Multiple prompt variations included
- Clear instructions for users
- Helpful context provided

---

## ✅ Test 8: Safety Features

**Test:** Verify safe operation in home directory

**Issue Found:** Original script used `git add .` which is dangerous in home directories

**Fix Applied:** Changed to `git add -u` which only stages:
- Modified tracked files
- Deleted tracked files

**Does NOT add:**
- Untracked files (system files, configs, etc.)
- New files unless explicitly staged

**Result:** ✅ PASSED
- Safe for home directory use
- Won't accidentally commit system files
- Users must explicitly stage new files
- Prevents accidental data exposure

## 🔄 Slack Command Tests (User Action Required)

The following commands need to be tested via Slack once the remote access service is running:

### Test Commands:

1. **Basic commit:**
   ```
   /cc git-commit
   ```
   Expected: Creates commit with smart message

2. **Commit and push:**
   ```
   /cc git-commit-and-push
   ```
   Expected: Commits and pushes to GitHub

3. **Check status:**
   ```
   /cc git-status
   ```
   Expected: Shows uncommitted changes

4. **Show summary:**
   ```
   /cc git-summary
   ```
   Expected: Shows last 5 commits + current state

5. **Restore context:**
   ```
   /cc restore-context
   ```
   Expected: Full context report in Slack

**Note:** These commands can be tested after starting the remote access service:
```bash
./start-everything.sh
```

---

## 🎯 Next Steps

### For User Testing:

1. Start remote access service:
   ```bash
   cd /Users/christophertolleymacbook2019
   ./start-everything.sh
   ```

2. Wait 30 seconds for service to initialize

3. Test via Slack:
   ```
   /cc git-status
   /cc restore-context
   ```

4. Make some changes and test commit:
   ```
   /cc git-commit
   ```

5. Before closing laptop:
   ```
   /cc git-commit-and-push
   ```

6. When you return:
   ```
   /cc restore-context
   ```

### For New Claude Sessions:

Copy and paste from `NEW-SESSION-PROMPT.txt` to give Claude full context about your autonomous development system.
