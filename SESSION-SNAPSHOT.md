export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-api03-..."  # For AI features
```

Optional but enhances features:
```bash
export SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN="..."  # For error monitoring
```

These persist across sessions if in your shell profile.

## 🚀 When You Come Back

### STEP 1: Start Everything
```bash
cd /Users/christophertolleymacbook2019
./start-everything.sh
```

### STEP 2: Wait 30 Seconds
Let services start up.

### STEP 3: Test From Slack
```
/cc echo "I'm back!"
```

### STEP 4: Verify
Should see response within 30-60 seconds.

### That's IT! ✅

## 📋 What Persists (Survives Laptop Close)

✅ All files (in filesystem)
✅ Git repository (local)
✅ GitHub commits (if pushed)
✅ Supabase database (cloud)
✅ N8n workflows (cloud)
✅ Slack integration (cloud)
✅ Knowledge base data (cloud)
✅ All analytics (cloud)
✅ MCP configurations (in ~/.config/claude-code/)

## ⚠️ What Doesn't Persist (Needs Restart)

❌ Running processes (start-remote-access.sh)
❌ Watchdog process (watchdog.sh)
❌ Heartbeat file (/tmp/claude-remote-access-heartbeat)
❌ Temporary logs (/tmp/*.log)

**Solution:** Just run `./start-everything.sh` and everything restarts!

---

## 📱 Slack Commands Available

Once restarted, use these from Slack:

```
/cc echo "test"                    # Test system
/cc system-status                  # Check health
/cc build-feature name "desc"      # Build feature
/cc search-solutions "query"       # Search KB
/cc git-status                     # Git status
/cc self-review feature /path      # Review code
/cc predict-issues feature /path   # Predict bugs
/cc map-codebase                   # Map project
```

---

## 🎯 Quick Recovery Guide

### If nothing works:
```bash
./stop-everything.sh
./start-everything.sh
```

### If that doesn't work:
```bash
killall start-remote-access.sh
killall watchdog.sh
rm /tmp/claude-remote-access-heartbeat
./start-everything.sh
```

### If you're completely lost:
```bash
# Read the guides
cat GETTING-STARTED.md          # Complete guide
cat QUICK-REFERENCE.txt         # Command cheat sheet

# Or just start it
./start-everything.sh
```

---

## 💡 Important Notes

### Service Startup:
- Takes ~5 seconds to start
- First poll happens within 15 seconds
- Allow 30 seconds for full initialization

### Response Times:
- Commands poll every 15 seconds
- Average response: 30 seconds
- Max response: 60 seconds
- This is normal! Not a bug.

### Logs to Check:
```bash
tail -f /tmp/remote-access-startup.log   # Service startup
cat /tmp/claude-remote-access-heartbeat  # Health check
```

### Git Safety:
- All work committed locally
- Push to GitHub when you set up remote
- Never lose code with Git

### Knowledge Base:
- 5 solutions already logged
- System learns from every build
- Gets smarter over time
