# ðŸ¤– New Session Startup Prompt for Claude Code

## Copy and paste this when opening a new Claude Code session:

---

I have an autonomous development system set up with:
- Remote access via Slack (/cc commands)
- Autonomous feature building with build-feature.sh
- Knowledge base system (solutions, analytics, learning)
- Git automation with smart commits
- Context restoration capabilities
- N8n workflows and Supabase integration

Please help me:
1. Check GETTING-STARTED.md for full context
2. Run: /cc restore-context (show me what we worked on)
3. Review recent commits: git log -5 --oneline
4. Check current status: git status

Then tell me what I was working on and what we should do next.

---

## Alternative: Quick Status Check

If you just need a quick status update, use this shorter version:

---

I have an autonomous development system. Check GETTING-STARTED.md for context.
Show me: recent commits, current git status, and what I was working on.

---

## For Specific Tasks

If you know what you want to work on, be more specific:

---

I have an autonomous development system (see GETTING-STARTED.md).
I want to [SPECIFIC TASK HERE].
First restore context to see where we left off.

---

## Files to Reference

Key documentation files Claude should check:
- GETTING-STARTED.md - Main guide
- QUICK-REFERENCE.txt - Command cheat sheet
- ULTIMATE-AUTONOMOUS-SYSTEM.md - Full system details
- KNOWLEDGE-BASE-COMPLETE.md - KB system
- GIT-SETUP-COMPLETE.md - Git integration

## What Claude Knows

Claude Code has NO memory of previous sessions, but it HAS:
- Access to all your files and scripts
- All configured MCP servers (Supabase, N8n)
- Git history and commit logs
- Knowledge base in Supabase

## What to Expect

After using the prompt above, Claude will:
1. Read GETTING-STARTED.md to understand your setup
2. Execute restore-context to show recent work
3. Check git commits to see what changed
4. Provide a summary of where you left off
5. Suggest next steps based on uncommitted changes

## Pro Tips

- Use the full prompt on your first message of the day
- Be specific about what you want to accomplish
- Claude can execute /cc commands via your remote access system
- All your work is backed up in Git (check with git log)
- Knowledge base persists in Supabase (survives sessions)

**Welcome back! Your autonomous development system is ready.** ðŸš€
