# Crash Bug Fix & Auto-Restart Protection

**Date:** 2025-10-19
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Result:** System is now crash-proof and self-healing

---

## Problem Identified

The `start-remote-access.sh` script would crash when receiving `build-feature` commands because:
1. No special handling for build-feature command syntax
2. No error recovery mechanism
3. Would terminate on any unexpected error
4. No health monitoring or auto-restart capability

---

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Build-Feature Command Support ✅

**Location:** start-remote-access.sh:160-188

Added intelligent command detection and routing:
```bash
if [[ "$command" == build-feature* ]]; then
    # Parse feature name and description
    # Export API key
    # Call build-feature.sh with proper parameters
    # Capture output and exit code
else
    # Normal shell command execution
fi
```

**Features:**
- Automatically detects `build-feature` prefix
- Parses feature name from command
- Extracts description (with or without quotes)
- Exports ANTHROPIC_API_KEY automatically
- Calls build-feature.sh with correct arguments
- Full error handling

### 2. Comprehensive Error Recovery ✅

**Location:** start-remote-access.sh:157-200

Wrapped command execution in error handler:
```bash
{
    # Execute command
    # ... execution logic ...
} || {
    # CRITICAL ERROR HANDLER
    # Log error
    # Set error response
    # Continue (never crash)
}
```

**Protection:**
- Command execution failures don't crash service
- Errors logged to /tmp/remote-access-errors.log
- User gets error message instead of silence
- Service continues running

### 3. Main Loop Error Protection ✅

**Location:** start-remote-access.sh:311-356

Wrapped entire polling loop in error handler:
```bash
while true; do
    {
        # Write heartbeat
        # Check for commands
        # Execute commands
    } || {
        # Log error
        # Send Slack alert
        # Continue (never crash)
    }
    sleep $POLL_INTERVAL
done
```

**Benefits:**
- Database errors don't crash service
- Network errors don't crash service
- Parse errors don't crash service
- Slack notifications on errors
- Detailed error logging

### 4. Health Monitoring ✅

**Location:** start-remote-access.sh:314

Added heartbeat mechanism:
```bash
echo "$(date +%s)" > /tmp/claude-remote-access-heartbeat
```

**Features:**
- Updates every 30 seconds
- Timestamp in Unix epoch format
- Monitored by watchdog
- Detects frozen service

### 5. Auto-Restart Protection (NEW!) ✅

**Created:** watchdog.sh

Self-healing watchdog service:
```bash
# Checks every 2 minutes:
# 1. Is process running?
# 2. Is heartbeat fresh? (<3 minutes old)
# 3. If either fails: auto-restart
```

**Features:**
- Process crash detection
- Freeze/hang detection via heartbeat
- Automatic restart on failure
- Slack notifications on restart
- Consecutive failure tracking
- Critical alert after 5 failures

### 6. Easy Startup Script (NEW!) ✅

**Created:** start-with-watchdog.sh

One-command startup for service + watchdog:
```bash
./start-with-watchdog.sh
```

**Features:**
- Starts both services
- Verifies startup
- Full status display
- Monitoring information
- Usage instructions

## Testing

### Before Fix:
```bash
# From database:
INSERT INTO claude_commands (command, status)
VALUES ('build-feature test "description"', 'pending');

# Result: Service crashed ❌
```

### After Fix:
```bash
# Same test:
INSERT INTO claude_commands (command, status)
VALUES ('build-feature test "description"', 'pending');

# Result: Service processes command successfully ✅
# Even if build-feature.sh fails, service continues ✅
# Watchdog monitors and auto-restarts if needed ✅
```

---

## Error Handling Flow

### Command Execution Errors:
```
Command fails → Error caught → Response saved to DB →
Service continues → User gets error message
```

### Main Loop Errors:
```
Database error → Error caught → Logged → Slack alert →
Service continues polling
```

### Service Crash:
```
Process dies → Watchdog detects (within 2 min) →
Auto-restart → Slack alert → Service running again
```

### Service Freeze:
```
Heartbeat stops updating → Watchdog detects (within 3 min) →
Auto-restart → Slack alert → Service running again
```

---

## Monitoring & Logs

### Health Check:
```bash
# Service running?
pgrep -f start-remote-access.sh

# Watchdog running?
pgrep -f watchdog.sh

# Heartbeat active?
cat /tmp/claude-remote-access-heartbeat
date -r /tmp/claude-remote-access-heartbeat
```

### Log Files:
```bash
# Service log
tail -f /tmp/remote-access.log

# Watchdog log
tail -f /tmp/watchdog.log

# Error log
tail -f /tmp/remote-access-errors.log
```

---

## Usage

### Start Everything:
```bash
./start-with-watchdog.sh
```

### Stop Everything:
```bash
killall start-remote-access.sh watchdog.sh
```

### Check Status:
```bash
pgrep -f start-remote-access.sh && echo 'Service: Running' || echo 'Service: Stopped'
pgrep -f watchdog.sh && echo 'Watchdog: Running' || echo 'Watchdog: Stopped'
```

### Test Build-Feature:
```bash
# From Slack:
/cc build-feature test-feature "Test the autonomous builder"

# From terminal (manual test):
./start-remote-access.sh  # Must be running
# Then insert into database:
INSERT INTO claude_commands (command, status, source)
VALUES ('build-feature hello-test "Simple test function"', 'pending', 'manual_test');
```

5. Add cron-based redundancy

### Ready to Use:
The system is now **production-ready** and **crash-proof**!

Try it:
```
/cc build-feature grant-matcher "Match grants to user profiles and notify"
```
